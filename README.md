# Cost-Sensitive Learning Under Constrained Resources for Maximizing Economic Impact

This repository contains the code of the paper "Cost-Sensitive Learning Under Constrained Resources for Maximizing Economic Impact" introducing a cost-sensitive learning framework that integrates observation-specific cost structures into ranking-based machine learning models. By optimizing for cost-sensitive expected precision using LambdaLoss, we demonstrate that machine learning models can be aligned with real-world decision constraints, prioritizing high-impact cases under resource limitations.

To execute the experiments yourself, one can run the [dataset_real.py](dataset_real.py) to test the performance on the data sets. 

## Data

The data of all benchmark and public imbalanced data sets that are used in the experiments can be found in the [data](data) folder.
